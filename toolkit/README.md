# KeyLink Toolkit

This directory contains utilities and reference implementations to extend KeyLink's functionality and interoperability. Each tool is designed to be simple, modular, and easy to integrate with your own projects.

## Contents

- **midi-bridge.js** — Utilities for mapping KeyLink JSON messages to and from MIDI 2.0 UMP and MIDI 1.0 messages.
- **transposer.js** — Functions for transposing audio or MIDI clips in response to key, mode, or chord changes.
- **osc-mapper.js** — Optional mapping between KeyLink JSON and integer-indexed OSC messages for legacy or ultra-low-latency use.

## Roadmap

- Example scripts and usage for each utility.
- Integration examples for Max/MSP, Node.js, and browser environments.
- Documentation for extending the toolkit with new protocols or features.
