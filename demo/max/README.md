## What It Demonstrates
- Sending and receiving KeyLink messages over UDP/OSC
- Real-time key, mode, and chord sync with other KeyLink clients
- Example UI for selecting and displaying tonal information

## How to Use
1. Open the patch file in Max/MSP (or Max for Live, if provided).
2. Follow any setup instructions in the patch or comments.
3. Ensure the KeyLink relay server is running (see main README for details).
4. Interact with the UI to send/receive key, mode, and chord changes.
